# Epollion

## Introduction

This project is a personal learning initiative inspired by the [Muduo](https://github.com/chenshuo/muduo) network library, a multithreaded C++ network library based on the reactor pattern. It is designed to deepen my understanding of asynchronous I/O, event-driven programming, and high-performance network server design on Linux.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Event Handling**: Powered by epoll for efficient I/O multiplexing.
- **Reactor Pattern**: Decouples I/O handling from business logic for modular design.
- **Multithreaded Design**: Scalable to handle multiple clients concurrently.
- **Lightweight HTTP Server**: Implements basic HTTP request and response handling.
- **Learning-Oriented Code**: Focus on clarity and foundational concepts.
